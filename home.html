<p>I want to talk about a little algorithm my coworkers and I developed. It is a O(n) time algorithm to find whether or not A is a subset of B. It relies on a few simple steps.
1) Let's say |B| = n , we need to first generate n prime numbers. This can be done in linear time using the sieve of Eratosthenes.
2) We map each object in A and each object in B to a prime number. This can be done in linear time by first considering S = A \union B, uniqeifying S, and then mapping each element of S to a unique prime number
3) We then take the product P(A) and P(B) defined by the product of all prime element mappings. 
4) If P(B) mod P(A) = 0, then A is a subset of B, because only if all the factors in the denominator cancel with ones in the numerator will the result be a whole number implying that all the elements in A were also in B. We constructed the prime mapping so that each product P(A) and P(B) can be written uniquely as a product of elements</p>
